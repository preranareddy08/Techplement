Developed a responsive Weather Forecast Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide real-time weather information for any location. The application features a sleek, modern design with a user-friendly interface, enabling users to search for and view weather conditions in various cities. Utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API, the application fetches current weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, and displays it dynamically. JavaScript was employed to handle API requests and data processing, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information is presented to the user.
